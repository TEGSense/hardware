# TEG Sense Board

This is a thermoelectric generator (TEG) boost converter used to power a connected battery or capacitor to periodically operate a microcontroller reading from a biometric sensor to compute blood oxygen saturation. That was a big sentence!

This is the board version used in the published paper, revision 3 of the rigid prototypes.
It is used in conjunction with the [SpO2 board](https://github.com/TEGSense/hardware-spo2).
The board has a few bugs, so it's recommended to start with the [flex version](https://github.com/TEGSense/hardware-flex), even if you're not going to use a flex PCB.
